### Solutions

1. The asynchronous nature is a necessary evil in web programming. The promises interface is
   difficult to learn about initially and the cause of a lot of bugs on a website. Errors caused by
   asynchronous behavior are difficult to spot as they are hard to replicate and get unexpected
   results in multiple attempts.
   Loose typing a disguised bane in programming. It allows flexibility but the ambiguity needs
   additional caution while writing code and debugging. Plus, statically typed languages are faster.
   Each web plaform has its own compatibility issues with Javascript because of lack of native
   support. Plus, keeping tabs of different module versions for javascript and the multiple
   libraries and frameworks creates more bloatware and gets handled differently by different
   browsers.
   
2. I will guess to make adoption easier. It was written in 10 days so I don't think much thought
   went into the v1 of Javascript. Asynchronous nature of the web infrastructure of client-server
   interface demands appropriate language design.
